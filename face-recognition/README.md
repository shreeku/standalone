### DESCRIPTION
After a learning curve on my new fond interest of face recognition and voice
recognition systems, this is the initial code push required for face recognition

Each of the python script is named after on what it is used for to avoid confusion

Thanks to the tutorials online, it was good to accomplish this effort
Future upgrades maybe to have it run automatically on multiple images at once

**PROS:**
Good to see that each script works as expected
Easy to understand code

**CONS:**
You need a system with high GPU to handle lots of images at once if you are
planning on running these on multiple images
